  - Once you set up an account at [formspree](http://formspree.io/) (and are hosting your site), submit a form and then activate it with the email link formspree provide
- Fill out the 'title' and 'URL' information under 'landing' - add or remove 'title' and 'url' elements as needed
- Add information to 'content' within aboutblurb - each 'content' element creates a separate paragraph
